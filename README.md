# Neural-Network-Keras_Dataset
This repository contains two closely related codes for implementing neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras. The primary difference between the two codes lies in the dataset used for training and testing. One code utilizes the Fashion MNIST dataset, while the other employs the Numbers MNIST dataset.
